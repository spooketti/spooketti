Hello! Iâ€™m Jonathan Liu, a student interested in robotics, software engineering, game development, and electrical engineering! I taught myself basic programming in the sixth grade and I have been improving my skills ever since. I have worked in various environments, such as full stack web development, game development through Unity, Godot, and Roblox Studio, robotics through WPILib and Arduino, Python bot automation, and various other applications of coding! I see computer science as a universal language across environments, so even if I am not proficient in a certain framework right now, I am open to learning!
